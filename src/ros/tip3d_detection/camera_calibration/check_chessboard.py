# This program accesses all the chessboard image files and identifies which one
# is suitable to do the camera calibration. The original raw images are in the
# folder called calibration_pictures and the image file names are in the format
# left_xx.ppm for images taken by left camera and right_xx.ppm for images taken
# by right camera (xx is the index number for the image). This program should be
# rerun once all chessboard image files in the calibration_pictures folder are
# acceptable.

# The chessboard used has 9 rows and 6 columns (number of rows and columns are 
# identified by counting number of inward corners of the squares)
